Working alongside designer Connor Diep from Outcome Design and media adviser Louise Hannan, we provided marketing communications project management for Dogs for the Disabled’s first Big Dogs Breakfast in May 2012.

We co-ordinated production of digital, print and3D content and branding for the event, as well as advising on brand messaging and corporate donor support. By the way, if you like what Dogs for the Disabled do, just click ‘like’ at their Facebook page.
