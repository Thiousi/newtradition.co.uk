Our involvement was two-fold: first, to audit, determine the priority and coordinate the production of multiple items of print required by multiple AXA Wealth sites and employees; and second, to create a definitive guide to AXA Wealth’s brand strategy — setting out its origins, purpose and practical implications for people’s day-to-day work — that would be suitable for all existing and new AXA Wealth employees.

In addition, we also carried out brand messaging analysis and  facilitated workshops with senior manager from across AXA Wealth’s UK business to design the schedule for the rollout of employee communications.
