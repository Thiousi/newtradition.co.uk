We began working with Moneyscope founder, Richard Allum, in June 2011 to craft a long-term brand strategy designed to underline Moneyscope’s reputation — its popularity among users as a simple, swift an easy-use-way to generate forecasts.

Since then, we have led the implementation of a simplified brand identity and its implementation across digital channels, working with designers Bond+Coyne and digital agency Firehoop.

In addition, we handle content generation and distribution of Moneyscope’s regular e-mails and blogs.
