(link: http://www.twitter.com/TheParaplannertext: Richard Allum), a leading figure within the UK paraplanning community, asked us a question: how can we create a genuinely unique event experience exclusively for fellow professionals?

Taking inspiration from native American powwows, and in order to make a clear break from convention, we created the (link: http://www.paraplannerspowwow.co.uk/ text: Paraplanners Powwow) – an event held under open skies, which exploited the unique character of teepees to act as catalysts for conversation and cooperation in-the-round.

By adopting (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference text: unconference principles) for content, participants were able to design their own day from the outset – determining the date and location of the event all the way to the topics for discussion on the day itself.

The success of the format has led to a proliferation of smaller regional Powwows in Leeds, London, Nottingham and Manchester, which are independently organised by paraplanners but supported by the original Paraplanners Powwow.
