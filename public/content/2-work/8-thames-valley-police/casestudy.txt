We worked closely with senior investigators, local area commanders and assistant chief constables to create Thames Valley Police’s prospectus ‘(link: http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/thamesvalleypoliceprospectussingle.pdf text: Policing the Thames Valley)’ which was published in anticipation of one of the most far-reaching reforms of modern policing — the election in November 2012 of (link: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/police/police-crime-commissioners/ text: Police and Crime Commissioners) for Force areas throughout England and Wales.

Produced in collaboration with designers (link: http://www.bondandcoyne.co.uk/ text: Bond and Coyne), and former Thames Valley police inspector (link: http://www.claremackintosh.com/ text: Clare Mackintosh), the Prospectus was the first document of its kind to be published in England and Wales.
