#### Our objective was to establish whether there was scope to reduce the investment of time and money required to produce brand communication and, if so, propose a solution.

We discovered that, by adapting branding conventions to reduce the number of sub-branded services and elevate the authority of a new Openwork brand mark, consistent application of common design standards across online and offline channels would save Openwork both time and money within less than 12 months.

Openworkâ€™s executive team approved the plan which is currently in its ninth month of rolling implementation.
