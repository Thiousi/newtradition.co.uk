Text: 

Working with Chris Nuelle, a designer at Bond and Coyne, the format draws heavily on the idea of ‘extraction’ of data — the process that samples obtained from crime scenes and individuals undergo via DNA analysis.

Because it is deliberately simple in format, the design acts as a potential template for future Annual Reports, eliminating the need for The Home Office to generate a new design each year and so reduce potential future costs of production.
