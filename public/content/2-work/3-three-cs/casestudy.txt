Richard Allum, a leading figure within the UK paraplanning community, asked us a question: how can we create a genuinely unique event experience exclusively for fellow professionals?

Taking inspiration from native American powwows, and in order to make a clear break from convention, we created the Paraplanners Powwow – an event held under open skies, which exploited the unique character of teepees to act as catalysts for conversation and cooperation in-the-round.

By adopting unconference principles for content, participants were able to design their own day from the outset – determining the date and location of the event all the way to the topics for discussion on the day itself.

The success of the format has led to a proliferation of smaller regional Powwows in Leeds, London, Nottingham and Manchester, which are independently organised by paraplanners but supported by the original Paraplanners Powwow.
