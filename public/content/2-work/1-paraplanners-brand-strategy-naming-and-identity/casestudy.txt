#### Brand strategy, naming and identity
We led the brand strategy, naming and identity design project that enabled our client, Paraplan Plus, to rebrand its core business – a paraplanning service for financial advice practices in the UK – as The Paraplanners. The strategy enabled Paraplan Plus to clearly establish itself as the parent business of two distinct brands: The Paraplanners and Moneyscope. 

Doing so established greater clarity in the relationship between the two brands, laying the foundations for separate brand communications strategy each with the potential to build brand equity in each of Paraplan Plus’s individual branded services.
