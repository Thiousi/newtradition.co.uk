### I’m on something of a mission.

I was watching the TV earlier today and saw quickquid.co.uk’s advert offering ‘payday’ loans at 2356% typical APR.

I thought it was wrong, so I started this Facebook Group.
The more join, the more we may be able to inifluence both regulators and lenders to insist on a fair rate for consumers who are clearly coping with small, short-term debt.

Let’s see how we do!
