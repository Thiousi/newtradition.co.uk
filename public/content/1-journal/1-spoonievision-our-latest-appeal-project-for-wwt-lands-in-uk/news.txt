Excerpt: 

An appeal by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) to save the world's rarest wading bird – the spoon-billed sandpiper (or 'spoonie') – from extinction is our latest project to go live.

The appeal for donations to save the spoonie is the third WWT appeal that Ian has been involved with in the past year, and the first collaboration he's undertaken with designer Claire Hartley.

### An appeal by the (link: http://www.wwt.org.uk/ text: Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT)) to save the world’s rarest wading bird – (link: http://www.wwt.org.uk/conservation/wwt-projects/spoon-billed-sandpiper/ text: the spoon-billed sandpiper) (or ‘spoonie’) – from extinction is our latest project to go live.

The appeal for donations to save the spoonie is the third WWT appeal that Ian has been involved with in the past year, and the first collaboration he’s undertaken with designer (link: http://www.clairehartley.com/ text: Claire Hartley).

Campaign creative includes: a carrier appeal with this month’s (link: http://issuu.com/wwtdigitial text: Waterlife) magazine mailing to WWT supporters; the creation of visual assets for WWT’s website (right) and email templates; and downloadable wallpapers and header images for supporters’ Twitter and Facebook profiles.

A direct mail appeal is also due to land in June 2015.

Ian was responsible for project coordination and copywriting, and Claire led creative direction and design.

#### What’s the communication problem we’re trying to solve?
The main communication challenge facing WWT is that – as well as keeping regular donors in touch with its conservation efforts – how does it pique the interest of UK wetlands centres’ annual pass holders whose principal motive may not be an interest in species and conservation but family day-trips instead?

So our approach has been to make the connection between conservation efforts in Russia and WWT’s bid to establish an ‘ark population’ of spoonies in the UK – a milestone which WWT hopes to reach in 2015 by breeding spoon-billed sandpipers in captivity for the first time ever.

A live video feed from the purpose-built spoonies’ sanctuary at WWT Slimbridge in Gloucestershire allowed us to bring this connection to life – thanks to the idea of (link: http://www.wwt.org.uk/support/our-appeals/spoon-billed-sandpiper/ text: ‘Spoonievision’).

It means the appeal communication has been split into two:

* One version is intended to capture the imagination of WWT wetlands centres’ day-tripper supporters. By inviting them to sign up for Spoonievision email alerts they’ll get the chance – fingers-crossed – to witness a first generation of spoonies hatching in captivity live on the web.
* The second version is a direct appeal to likely donors to donate to a ‘headstarting’ programme in the spoon-billed sandpiper’s native Russian tundra.
