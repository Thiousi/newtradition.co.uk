### It seems to me that plenty of people I meet in brand communication roles find pinpointing the effects of the transition from promotional communication to communicative promotion pretty vexing.

After all, everything you learned up until this point is being turned on its head because of the profound effect of technology. Technology that brings with it new and exciting possibilities to create engaging interaction with consumers of your products or services.

What used to be black and white for some, is now messy, fuzzy and organic; old rules make way for new parameters, and stuff just isn’t as linear as it used to be.

That’s why I love this slidedeck by (link: http://paulisakson.typepad.com/planning/ text: Paul Isakson). It simply expresses what’s happening and what’s likely to happen in future to shape the design of engaging brand communication.
