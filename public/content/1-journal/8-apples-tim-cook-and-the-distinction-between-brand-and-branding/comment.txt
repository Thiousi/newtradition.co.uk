Away from the furore among analysts about Apple’s — apparently — (link: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9822615/Apple-revenue-misses-and-iPhone-disappoints.html text: disappointing results yesterday), the brand’s chief executive, Tim Cook, uttered a phrase which precisely states the distinction between brand and branding.

He said: “We could put the Apple brand on a lot of things and sell a lot more stuff. The most important thing to us is that our customers love our products, not just buy them but love them.”

Branding = ’We could put the Apple brand on a lot of things and sell a lot more stuff.’

Brand =  ’The most important thing to us is that our customers love our products, not just buy them but love them.’

And that’s why Apple is the biggest brand in the world.
