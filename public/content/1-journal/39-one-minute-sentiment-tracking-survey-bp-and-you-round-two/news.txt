### You may remember that, a couple of weeks ago, I invited people to contribute to a survey about sentiment towards BP and politicians associated with the Deepwater Horizon incident.

Before I publish the results, I thought it would be interesting to ask the same questions once again to see how sentiment may have shifted.

Given the fact that BP are cautiously optimistic that it has capped the leak, today seems like a pretty good day to pose the questions.

So, if you’ve got a minute (because that’s all the time it should take to complete), I’d be grateful if you could (link: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/YLWJ2CF text: click here to take survey).

Thanks very much.
