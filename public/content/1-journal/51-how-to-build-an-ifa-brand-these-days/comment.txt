These are visuals that I posted to (link: http://www.slideshare.net/mrianthomas/how-to-build-a-brand-these-days-2940363 text: Slideshare) and at MRM over the weekend that was put together for a presentation I delivered last week to a group of independent financial advice (IFA) business leaders. The issue I was asked to address was ‘How to build an IFA brand’. The visuals suggests what to concentrate on to build a brand — any brand — these days.
