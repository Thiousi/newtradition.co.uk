Former (link: http://www.guardian.co.uk/ text: Guardian) technology writer (link: http://twitter.com/#!/jackschofield text: Jack Schofield), shared an intriguing link to a news item in the (link: http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_18107851?nclick_check=1 text: Silicon Valley Mercury News) earlier this week.

It intrigued me for two reasons: first, that (link: http://facebook.com/ text: Facebook) had decided to establish a network of 70 international representatives to establish a quasi-diplomatic service in key regions of the world and, second, that (link: http://google.com/ text: Google) had already establish as similar operation in 2006.

The Google information was news to me. It’s not unusual for brands to employ corporate communications teams whose role is to maintain positive relations with both state and non-state actors both nationally and globally. It remains to be seen if the nature of the team that Facebook intends to establish veers away from this traditional role.

However, reading between the lines, the focus of the announcement suggests that Facebook is acknowledging a need to insulate its operation from unwanted legal and regulatory intrusion in the future – or an outright ban of its technology altogether – in nations where the nature of its operating model runs counter to prevailing political philosophy.

The story in the Silicon Valley Mercury News ran:

*"Facebook’s new global policy team will monitor the local political landscape and act as multilingual, TV-friendly communicators in countries and for cultures that, in many cases, have very different values and laws about privacy and personal communications than the U.S. Facebook is confronting its emergence as a global organization whose membership is much larger than the population of most countries, and whose technology can antagonize both Middle Eastern dictators and European democracies fretful about privacy. The international directors of policy, as Facebook calls them, will grapple with those challenges."*
