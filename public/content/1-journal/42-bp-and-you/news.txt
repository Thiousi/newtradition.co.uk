### In case you missed my tweets yesterday, I’m trying to gather a decent sample of opinions on perceptions of BP, Barack Obama et al in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon incident.

I plan to publish the findings on the blog soon. If you’ve got a minute — because there’s only one question and you just have a few buttons to click — I’d be very grateful if you could (link: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/QHQHCXS text: click here to take survey).

Thanks to all the people who have been kind enough to complete the survey so far. (And my apologies if you thought I was publishing the findings!)
