Just imagine if one of the many financial services brands or independent financial advisers — regularly berated by self-proclaimed MoneySavingExpert Martin Lewis — broadcast email content that was so ambiguous that it required the addition of an (ish) in the copy?

They’d be hung out to dry wouldn’t they? (In fact, they are hung out to dry and then fined by a regulator.)

So take a look at this week’s (link: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/tips/09-09-2009/ text: email) from Mr Lewis and see if you can spot the ‘ish’-es peppering the copy.

In the interests of clarity and fair treatment of consumers, are the flights from Ryanair £5 pounds or not? Are ‘free’ Star Wars models worth £4 or not and — for that matter — are they ‘free’? And can you print 100s of photos for free or not?

Martin Lewis is supposed to be a champion for the fair treatment of consumers and their rights, and good for him too.

But that is a privileged platform and, if you use it as a means of delivering aggregated money-saving links, then you should adhere to the same principles that you insist others should apply to their own promotional activity.

For instance, Mr Lewis could declare his intention to voluntarily adhere to the principles and rules applied to financial promotions in the UK that thousands of professionally qualified financial advisers are expected to abide by.

At the very least, content published in Mr Lewis’s name should be crystal clear about the details of available offers — and especially the potential costs.

Not to do so is misleading(ish).

No. Scratch that. It is misleading.
