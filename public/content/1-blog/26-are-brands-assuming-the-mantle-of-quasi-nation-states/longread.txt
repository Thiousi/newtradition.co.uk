Over the past 18 months or so, I’ve become fascinated by the apparent parallels between the dynamics of nation state building and statecraft, and the transnational behaviour and attributes of global and networked brands; in particular, the (link: http://www.newtradition.co.uk/612/google-china-and-my-i-told-you-so-moment/ text: Google v China skirmish) and the more recent tensions between the (link: http://www.newtradition.co.uk/1732/wikileaks-the-10th-of-our-12linksofchristmas/ text: US State Department and Attorney General and WikiLeaks) piqued my interest.

Even though Marx warned of the globalising effects of capitalism, something else appears to be going on here because it’s not just economic capital that is transcending geographic borders; it’s ideas and movements too.

Somehow, populations of people — and not just business brands — are emerging as brands too; often their apparent power is unrelated to their scale.

This necessarily means that the nature and governance of brands as global actors, and their relationship and alliances both within and beyond the boundaries of nation states, are of real significance to future global political, social and economic stability.

You’ll have seen from those blog posts at NewTradition’s site that these episodes revived distant memories of my university days; specifically, of the ideas that were dealt with in Benedict Anderson’s (link: http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1844670864/?tag=googhydr-21&hvadid=4435846053&ref=pd_sl_5jw0yhi6km_b text: ‘Imagined Communities’).

> Somehow, populations of people — and not just business brands — are emerging as brands too; often their apparent power is unrelated to their scale.

So I re-read Anderson’s book and, once I’d done that, I dug into Eric Hobsbawm’s (link: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nations-Nationalism-since-1780-Programme/dp/0521439612/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1303817853&sr=1-3 text: ‘Nations and Nationalism’) and collection of essays on (link: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Globalisation-Democracy-Terrorism-Eric-Hobsbawm/dp/0349120668/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1303818291&sr=1-1 text: ‘Globalisation, democracy and terrorism’). (To be frank, I’ve read more academic texts in the past year or so than I did throughout my University career.)

And I’m left with the nagging concern that the revolution in communications technology — and it’s worth bearing in mind that Anderson considers the ownership and mechanics of media to have been vital to successful nation building — is creating the conditions in which a new kind of nation state can be conceived: ‘brand nation states’.

Whether there is such a thing as a brandnationstate, I’m not sure.

I’m not sure if brands can genuinely transcend geographic borders and deploy the kind of diplomatic muscle that nation states are able — and, just as often, are unable — to.

I’m not sure if dispersed populations of people, who congregate under the auspices of a brand, really do wield the kind of power and authority that nation states — with their military, legal and governmental instruments of enforcement — do.

I’m just interested to test the ideas. So I’l be digging a bit deeper into the topic.
