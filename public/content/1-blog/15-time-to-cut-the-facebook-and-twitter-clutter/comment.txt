Whether you’re inclined to regard (link: http://aol.com/ text: Aol) as a barometer of cultural trends or not, I’m pretty sure that there’s something in David Shing’s (link: http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2011/oct/27/facebook-twitter-clutter-aol text: reported prediction).

Obviously, it’s worth bearing in mind that (link: http://shingy.com/ text: Mr Shing’s) comments may well be self-serving too: it helps to be in the business of targeted content if more targeted content is what’ll win the day in an ‘attention economy’.

Nonetheless his comments should be seized on – at a reasonably contemplative pace – by people like (link: http://www.theworldinstituteofslowness.com/home text: The World Institute of Slowness); they’ve been banging on about the need for a more measured approach to human existence since 1999. (And, no, the irony’s not lost on me that I’m helping to add to the clutter referred to by Mr Shing.)
