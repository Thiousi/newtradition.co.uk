### Once upon a time people either walked or tamed a beast of the wild to get from A to B. So it was conventional to either walk or ride; tradition dictated that you walked or rode from A to B.

Then some bright spark — or, more likely, countless sparks in collaboration — invented the wheel. So conventional wisdom — which had determined that walking or riding were the principal methods of getting from A to B — was challenged and changed and a new tradition was born.

But everyone didn’t stop walking; they just applied wheels to certain means of getting from A to B, and tamed beasts of the wild and walking for others.

So the conventions on which an old tradition was founded became absorbed into a new tradition; a new tradition that was the consequence of the discovery, application, adaptation and communication of technological ideas.

(And by technology I mean things like paper, doors, rope, steam and so on and so on.)

What’s significant, though, is that the basic idea didn’t change: People wanted to get from A to B and they found new ways of doing it.

New ways of doing things can be epochal, incremental or incidental, but they are always inspired and effected by people along with other people.

In my line of work — I provide clients with advice about executing communications strategies that will bring their brand to life — it seems that we’re at an epochal tipping point.

So (and I know this will sound like a high-minded ambition) this blog will be all about the discovery, application, adaptation and communication of ideas that are either epochal, incremental or incidental.

Let’s hope it fits the billing!
