Summary: Not only were the nominations for the online world’s equivalent of the Oscars — The Webby Awards — (link: http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=15 text: published yesterday) but, by happy coincidence, (link: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/technology-startup100/8418664/Start-Up-100-StrategyEye-interactive-guide.html text: The Telegraph’s Tech Start-Up 100 awards) were held in London yesterday too.

On the face of it, these are unrelated events, but four of the nominations in both the Webbys and the Start-Up 100 lists featured in our (link: http://www.newtradition.co.uk/1771/our-12-links-of-christmas-2010/ text: 12 Links of Christmas 2010). These are the links that we considered to be enjoyable, enlightening or just plain interesting last year and published in December 2010. (Here’s the (link: http://www.newtradition.co.uk/552/so-heres-my-twelve-links-of-christmas/ text: 2009 12 Links) too.)

Coincidentally, the (link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc text:  RSA Animate talk by Dan Pink), which we featured in our ‘(link: http://www.newtradition.co.uk/1983/are-you-motivated-by-what-you-think-motivates-you/ text: Are you motivated by what you think motivates you?)’ post, also received a Webbys nod, whereas our 12 Links preference was for the RSAnimate version of David Harvey’s talk on (link: http://www.youtube.com/user/theRSAorg#p/u/75/qOP2V_np2c0 text: The Crises of Capitalism). Either way, RSAnimate is a deserving Webby Award nominee as far as we’re concerned.

The great thing about the Webbys is that there are two gongs available per category: one awarded by a judging panel and one based on a public vote.

And with the (link: http://webby.aol.com/ text:  voting site now live) for The People’s Choice awards, we thought we’d do our bit to gently nudge you in the direction of clicking in favour of the nominees featured in our 12 Links of Christmas 2010.

So here’s the nominees that caught our eye last year, why we picked them and — therefore — why we’ll be voting for them:

* 1st link of Christmas: Arcade Fire’s The Wilderness Downtown ((link: http://vimeo.com/9679622 text: here’s the video))
* 8th link of Christmas: Sam O’Hare’s tilt-shift film The Sandpit (video at the top of this post)
* 12th link of Christmas: OK! Go’s This Too Shall Pass ((link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w text: here’s the video))

Sticking with the 12 Links, but away from the Webbys, social recruiting platform (link: http://www.bravenewtalent.com/ text: Brave New Talent) was last night named as runner-up in the education and recruitment category of (link: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/technology-startup100/8418664/Start-Up-100-StrategyEye-interactive-guide.html text: The Telegraph’s Tech Start-Up 100).

We first posted about this remarkable project back in July 2010 after listening to the founder, (link: http://twitter.com/#!/luciant text: Lucian Tarnowski), speak about the idea at a tweet-up in London.

It’s a genuinely innovative idea which, as we posted at the time, is ‘effecting a change in the way in which businesses, and a generation of talent emerging from the nation’s schools, col­leges and higher education institutions, can connect.’ That’s why it made our 12 Links.

Finally, this post also gives us a chance to namecheck (link: http://twitter.com/#!/petematthew text: Pete Matthew), founder of video-based financial education site (link: http://meaningfulmoney.tv/ text: Meaningful Money) which, in February, picked up the Professional Adviser Financial Education Award for 2011. Meangingful Money was our 7th Link of Christmas and here’s why we included it among our 12 Links.
