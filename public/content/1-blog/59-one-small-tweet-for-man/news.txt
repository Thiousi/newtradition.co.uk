### It’s amazing how much (link: http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/apollo40/ text: Apollo Eleven’s) legendary mission to the moon continues to capture the imagination of people.

For those of us who weren’t quite born — or were too young to remember — it’s hard to imagine what it must have been like to follow the Lunar mission from the TV and radio coverage on Earth.

(link: http://www.twitter.com/ text: Twitter) may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but the idea of tweeting the progress of the mission in real time is simply brilliant.

That’s just what (link: http://twitter.com/apolloeleven text: @apolloeleven) is broadcasting: a stream of tweets that replicates communication between Mission Control and the commander module in real-time on the 40th anniversary of the event.

It’s a great application of Twitter; I just love the way technology like that can be applied to bring historical events to life.
