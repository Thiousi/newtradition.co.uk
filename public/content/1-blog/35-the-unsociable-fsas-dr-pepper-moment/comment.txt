Back in July, I presented a webcast for BrightTalk’s (link: http://www.thoughtleadershiplive.com/ text: Thought Leadership Live) programme about the UK Financial Services Authority’s (FSA) (link: http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/Doing/Regulated/Promo/pdf/new_media.pdf text: latest guidance) on the application of social web tools by regulated businesses.

In the slide-deck, I explain why I think the FSA’s stance is counter-inuitive to its own statutory objectives and principles, and why the application of social tools can increase confidence in the market and improve consumer protection.

In other words, it suggests why the FSA has got the wrong end of the stick. I just wonder how many other regulators are making the same mistake?

(By the way, don’t be put off by the slide count. It takes a fair few slides to manually animate a storyline on Slideshare!)
