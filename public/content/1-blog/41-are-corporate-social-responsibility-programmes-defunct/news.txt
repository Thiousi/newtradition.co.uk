### I don’t often plug work by a colleague, but (link: http://www.twitter.com/jennycrossland text: Jenny Crossland) has put together a really interesting case for the prosecution against running CSR programmes.

For a CSR specialist, her argument may seem counter-intuitive, but Jenny makes a compelling case — especially in the light of (link: http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jun/16/boardroom-pay-soars-despite-fragile-economy text: today’s news) that board members of the FTSE100 businesses have seen bonuses increase by an average of 22.5 per cent while pay for directors of those businesses had typically increased by seven per cent (according to research from (link: http://www.incomesdata.co.uk/ text: Income Data Services)).

I’d be interested to hear what you think.
