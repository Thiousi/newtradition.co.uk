Here’s a thought.

What if the uproar about the Gap logo redesign (above) that’s (link: http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/october/new-gap-logo text: occupying the blogs) and tweets of the design community — and beyond — is an elaborate ruse to buy Gap more attention?

It’s an idea that my colleague at NewTradition, (link: http://www.twitter.com/MlleCameron text: Maxine Cameron), was musing about earlier and I floated in an exchange of tweets with (link: http://www.twitter.com/crispinheath text: Crispin Heath) of (link: http://www.teamspirit.uk.com/ text: Team Spirit).

Here’s the thinking: Let’s accept that the brand visual ID refresh and rollout really is a car crash in slow-motion. Why would a brand as experienced as Gap make that kind of misjudgement?

Now consider the attention that the brand is beginning to gain by releasing the logo, sporadically, world wide and allowing it to be ridiculed, lambasted and — in some instances — alternatives being offered up. (I particularly like the tongue-in-cheek sideswipe by (link: http://www.id29.com/ text: id29) (pictured below) posted at Under Consideration’s (link: http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/dont_mind_the_gap_or_the_square.php text: Brand New) site earlier today.)

Then you add into the mix the curious post by Gap at its (link: http://www.facebook.com/gap?v=wall text: Facebook page) where it says:

*Thanks for everyone’s input on the new logo! We’ve had the same logo for 20+ years, and this is just one of the things we’re changing. We know this logo created a lot of buzz and we’re thrilled to see passionate debates unfolding! So much so we’re asking you to share your designs. We love our version, but we’d like to see other ideas. Stay tuned for details in the next few days on this crowd sourcing project.*

What if Gap are just seeking to build anticipation and then reveal to the world a brand spanking new ID which the designers of the world fall in love with?

Risky, but it might just work.

And, even if it’s not the strategy that’s in play, there’s still time, Gap. There’s still time.

What do you think?
