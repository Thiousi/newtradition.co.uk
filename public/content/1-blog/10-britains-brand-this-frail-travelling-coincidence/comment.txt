Excerpt: It may sound like a glass-half-full definition but Frank Cotterell Boyce’s reference to this line from Philip Larkin’s The Whitsun Wedding, perfectly pinpoints the poignant curiosities of the British character that his script for the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony so brilliantly conveyed.

It may sound like a glass-half-full definition but Frank Cotterell Boyce’s reference to this line from Philip Larkin’s (link: http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/178047 text: The Whitsun Wedding), perfectly pinpoints the poignant curiosities of the British character that his script for the (link: http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/live-video/p00wm0br text: London 2012 Olympics) Opening Ceremony so brilliantly conveyed.

The Larkin reference is included — about 12 minutes in — in this fascinating interview for Radio 4’s (link: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnj3/ text: ‘Broadcasting House’) in which Mr Cotterell Boyce describes the behind-the-scenes experience of what, for me at least, was the defining cultural moment of 2012 in the United Kingdom.
