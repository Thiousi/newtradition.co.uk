I love a bit of heretical thought and (link: http://whatconsumesme.com/ text: Bud Caddell) has delivered a (link: http://whatconsumesme.com/2010/posts-ive-written/who-says-the-future-needs-an-advertising-agency/ text: blog-post) with spades of the stuff by posing the question: ‘Who says the future needs an advertising agency?’

Craftily controversial headlines often disappoint with their dry status quo conclusions — but not Bud’s. This is a really sharp opinion piece about the future of the ad agency model and its relevance in a fragmenting media world. Well worth a read.

Err. That’s it.
